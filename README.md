# Neural Network Training Algorithm
An implimentaion of a nueral network training algorithm written in python. This algorithm can be used on any standard supervised classification dataset.

The results obtained from this algorithm are typically 100-200 percent more accurate than random guessing based on the number of categories in the dataset.
